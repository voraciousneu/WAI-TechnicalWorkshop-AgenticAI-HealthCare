Agent Overview

Instead of asking questions, the agent:

Observes text input — as the user reads, types, or edits text.

Analyzes reading and writing patterns, e.g.:

letter reversals (b/d, p/q),

transpositions (form/from),

omissions or skipped words,

spelling approximations and phoneme-grapheme mismatches,

prolonged time per word (keystroke timing if available).

Estimates reading fluency by analyzing how quickly text is read or typed (if you capture reading speed, eye-tracking, or audio).

Triggers assistive actions (text-to-speech, spacing/font changes, highlighting, pacing aids) automatically when indicators appear.

Engages the user with gentle coaching messages like

“Would you like me to read the next sentence aloud?”
“Try focusing on one line at a time — want a highlight ruler?”
