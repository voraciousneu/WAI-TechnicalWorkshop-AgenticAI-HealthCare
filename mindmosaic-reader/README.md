# üè• Medical Reading Assistant - Agentic AI for Dyslexia Accessibility

A comprehensive healthcare accessibility solution that uses **Agentic AI** to help people with dyslexia understand medical information. This demo showcases how AI can perceive, reason, act, and learn to provide personalized medical text adaptations.

## üéØ Demo Use Case: Smart Medical Information Assistant

### **The Problem**
Medical information is often written in complex language with technical terminology that can be challenging for people with dyslexia to understand. This creates barriers to healthcare accessibility and patient safety.

### **Our Solution**
An intelligent AI agent that:
- **Perceives** medical text complexity and dyslexia indicators
- **Reasons** about appropriate accessibility interventions  
- **Acts** by providing simplified text, visual adaptations, and audio support
- **Learns** from user interactions to improve over time

### **Demo Scenario**
```
Original Medical Text:
"Take 2 tablets by mouth twice daily with food. Monitor for side effects 
including nausea, dizziness, and allergic reactions. Contact your physician 
if symptoms persist or worsen."

AI-Enhanced Version:
"Take 2 pills. Do this 2 times each day. Always take with food to avoid 
stomach upset. Watch for these problems: feeling sick to your stomach, 
feeling dizzy, or having an allergic reaction. Call your doctor if you 
feel worse or the problems don't go away."
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Option 1: Rule-Based Demo (No API Key Required)**
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
cd mindmosaic-reader

# Run the application
./runScript.sh

# Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
# Click "Load Demo Text" to see the medical reading assistant in action
```

### **Option 2: LLM-Enhanced Demo (With Groq API - Recommended)**
```bash
# Get your free Groq API key from https://console.groq.com/
# Create .env file in backend directory
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > backend/.env

# Run the application
./runScript.sh

# Experience ultra-fast AI-powered medical text analysis with Groq
```
